# Excessive tick tack to project
## Because I needed something to do
### Based on Robert Heaton's beginner/intermediate projects
Contains a 'tick-tack-toe' engine, as well as "ai"'s of varying degrees of skill to play against. Also included is the minimax algorithm's cache of boards, which speeds it up significantly and will be repopulated if deleted. Also includes server and client for play across sockets.
