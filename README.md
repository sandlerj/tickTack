# Excessive tick-tack-toe project
## Because I needed something to do
### Based on Robert Heaton's beginner/intermediate projects
Contains a 'tick-tack-toe' engine, as well as "ai"'s of varying degrees of skill to play against. Also included is the minimax algorithm's cache of boards, which speeds it up significantly and will be repopulated if deleted. Also includes server and client for play across sockets.

#### To-do:
* Change cache saving to JSON format
* tkinter or curses interface
* redesign using flask for web app deployment
